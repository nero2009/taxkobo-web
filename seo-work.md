## 🎯 NEW: Influencer Marketing Strategy (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Why Target Influencers?

**Influencers are the PERFECT audience for TaxKobo:**

1. **High foreign currency earnings**
   - Brand deals from international companies (USD, EUR, GBP)
   - YouTube AdSense payments (always USD)
   - Instagram/TikTok creator funds (USD)
   - Affiliate commissions from global brands
   - Sponsored content from overseas companies

2. **Tax-naive but high-earning**
   - Many Nigerian influencers earning ₦5M-50M+ annually
   - Often don't know about PIT, CRA, or VAT thresholds
   - First-time business owners (no accounting background)
   - Scared of LIRS but don't know where to start

3. **Viral sharing potential**
   - One Instagram story = thousands of engaged followers
   - Community effect: "If [popular influencer] uses it, I should too"
   - Natural word-of-mouth amplification
   - Visual content creators = perfect for social sharing

4. **Less competitive SEO**
   - "Influencer tax Nigeria" - almost zero competition
   - "YouTube income tax Nigeria" - wide open
   - "Brand deal tax calculator" - untapped niche

5. **Growing Nigerian influencer economy**
   - Skit makers: Mr Macaroni, Lasisi Elenu, Sabinus, Broda Shaggi
   - Beauty/lifestyle: Dimma Umeh, Jackie Aina (dual citizen), Aproko Doctor

**Priority:** MEDIUM (week 3)
**Quantity:** Create 5 videos, post 1/week

**Video 1: Hook Video**
- Hook: "If you're making money from Instagram or YouTube in Nigeria, you NEED to know this about taxes 👇"

---

### Influencer Outreach Strategy

#### Tier 1: Micro-influencers (10k-100k followers)
**Why start here?**
- More likely to respond to DMs (less flooded inbox)
- Actually need the tool (macro-influencers have accountants)
- Will share if they find it genuinely useful
- Build relationships before scaling up

**Target List (20-30 influencers):**
- Nigerian tech reviewers (10-50k followers)
- Beauty micro-influencers (Lagos-based preferred)
- Lifestyle content creators
- Finance/money YouTubers (they WILL share tax tools - natural fit)
- Food bloggers (often do sponsored posts)

**Outreach Script (Instagram/Twitter DM):**
```
Hey [Name]!

Love your content on [specific thing they recently posted about - PERSONALIZE THIS].

Quick question: Are you filing PIT for your brand deals/YouTube earnings?

I built a free calculator specifically for Nigerian influencers earning foreign income (handles EUR/USD/GBP). Does all the LIRS calculations + shows you the CRA benefit (most influencers don't know about this and overpay).

No pitch, no spam. Just thought it might save you some headache during tax season (March 31 is coming!).

Want the link?

- Tej (TaxKobo founder)

P.S. It's literally 3 inputs, takes 30 seconds. Try it and let me know if it's helpful!
```

**Follow-up if they respond:**
```
Awesome! Here it is: taxkobo.com

Try calculating with your 2024 earnings. The CRA section usually surprises people (you might be paying less tax than you think!).

If you find it useful and want to share with your audience, I'd be super grateful. But no pressure - just wanted to help out 🙏
```

**If they share:**
```
Thank you SO much for sharing! 🙏

Your followers are already using it. If there's anything tax-related that confuses you, let me know - happy to write a guide or create content about it.

Always here to help Nigerian creators navigate this tax stuff!
```

---

#### Tier 2: Mid-tier influencers (100k-500k)
**Approach:** Offer value FIRST (give before you ask)

**Strategy: Custom Tax Breakdown**
1. Research their approximate earnings (YouTube Social Blade, brand deal estimates)
2. Create a custom tax breakdown FOR THEM using the calculator
3. Send it unsolicited with no ask

**Outreach Script:**
```
Hey [Name],

Big fan of your work! Saw your recent [specific content].

I run TaxKobo (tax calculator for Nigerian creators). For fun, I estimated what your PIT might look like based on public YouTube stats:

[Attach screenshot of calculator with their estimated numbers]

Estimated 2024 PIT: ₦[X] (includes CRA benefit)

No idea if this is accurate to your actual numbers, but thought you might find it interesting. Most creators I talk to are shocked by either:
1. How much CRA saves them, or
2. How close they are to VAT threshold (₦25M)

If you want to run your real numbers (totally confidential), calculator is at taxkobo.com

Keep creating! 🔥

- Tej
```

**Why this works:**
- You gave value before asking for anything
- Shows you actually know their content (not generic spam)
- Demonstrates the tool's usefulness
- Natural curiosity: "Wait, am I close to VAT threshold?"

---

#### Tier 3: Macro-influencers (500k+)
**Approach:** Partnership/Sponsorship (they won't share for free)

**Options:**

**Option A: Sponsored Content (Paid)**
- Offer: ₦100k-300k for one Instagram post/story + Reel
- They create content about filing taxes, mention TaxKobo
- Authenticity is key: Let them use it first, speak from experience
- Target: Finance influencers, lifestyle creators who discuss money

**Option B: Affiliate Partnership**
- When TaxKobo becomes paid SaaS, offer 20-30% commission
- Track referrals with their custom link
- Passive income for them = motivation to promote

**Option C: Free Premium Access (when platform launches)**
- "Be a TaxKobo partner"
- Free access to full platform (worth ₦X/month)
- In exchange: 2-3 posts per year about tax season
- Make them feel special: "You're one of 10 creator partners"

**Target Macro-influencers:**

### Influencer-Specific FAQ (Add to Website)

**New FAQ questions to add:**

**6. "Do I need to pay tax on YouTube earnings in Nigeria?"**
> **Answer:** Yes! YouTube AdSense payments (received in USD) are taxable income in Nigeria under the Personal Income Tax Act. You must convert your YouTube earnings to Naira using the official CBN exchange rate at the time of each payment and include the total in your annual PIT filing by March 31st. Even if you haven't withdrawn the money to your Nigerian bank account, it's still taxable income.

**7. "What about Instagram/TikTok brand deals and sponsorships?"**
> **Answer:** All brand deals, sponsored posts, and paid partnerships are fully taxable income, whether paid in Naira, USD, EUR, or any other currency. This includes product gifting if it has monetary value (e.g., brand sends you ₦200k phone = ₦200k taxable income). You must track all payments and file PIT on your total annual income.

**8. "I'm only a small influencer with 10k followers. Do I still need to file taxes?"**
> **Answer:** If your total annual income from ALL sources (brand deals, AdSense, affiliate marketing, day job, etc.) is above ₦300,000, you are required to file PIT in Nigeria. The number of followers doesn't matter - only your total income. Even small influencers earning ₦1M+ per year must file by March 31st to avoid penalties.

**9. "What is the VAT threshold for influencers?"**
> **Answer:** If your annual turnover (total income before expenses) exceeds ₦25 million, you must register for VAT with FIRS. Many successful influencers (50k+ subscribers, regular brand deals) are above this threshold and don't realize it. TaxKobo's calculator will alert you if you're approaching or above the VAT threshold.

**10. "Can I deduct my camera, ring light, and editing software?"**
> **Answer:** Yes! Business expenses like camera equipment, lighting, microphones, editing software (Adobe, Final Cut Pro), laptop, and even a portion of your internet/electricity bills are tax-deductible for content creators. Our full TaxKobo platform helps you track these deductions throughout the year.
